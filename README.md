CompPhy is a web-based collaborative platform for comparing phylogenies. It allows distant users to store and share phylogenetic projects. It also enables them interacting through a nice interface by modifying (coloring, rerooting, etc.) the trees of their collections. Modifications are immediatly updated on all connected user browsers.

The main aim of this repository is to show how we implemented the technologies we are using.

Please do not hesitate to try it. If you want to share some proposition to upgrade CompPhy, feel free to contact us on CompPhy's website: http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/compphy/?p=contact. We will do our best to consider your message and answer it quickly.
